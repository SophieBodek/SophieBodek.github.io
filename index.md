**Welcome!** Iâ€™m Sophie, a graduate student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. I work in the Bob & Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab [(EFML)](https://cee.stanford.edu/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory-efml) under the mentorship of [Dr. Nick Ouellette](https://web.stanford.edu/~nto/index.shtml). My research interests include sediment transport, geomorphology, and (of course) environmental fluid mechanics. I'm currently working on a project that investigates stress history in granular beds. 

I originally studied geology at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a B.A. in Earth Sciences in 2018. During my time at Penn, I worked with Doug Jerolmack at the Penn Soft Earth Dynamics [(PennSED)](https://pennsed.seas.upenn.edu/) lab where I performed experiments to examine the shape changes undergone by sediment particles as they experience transport. I also assisted with a project that investigated the effect of moisture on threshold wind speeds for aeolian transport through lab experiments and fieldwork at White Sands National Park in New Mexico.

I then earned a M.S. in Geology from the University of Delaware in 2020, where I was advised by fluvial geomorphologist [Jim Pizzuto](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/departments/es/faculty/james-pizzuto/). My thesis involved fieldwork and numerical modeling to evaluate coarse sediment transport at the White Clay Creek in Pennsylvania. I also helped with projects that examined riverbank stratigraphy and wetland deposits to infer historical land use changes in the Mid-Atlantic region, as well as fluvial deposits along the Powder River in Montana to investigate river meander migration. 

In between graduating with my master's degree and starting a PhD in 2022, I taught at Penn State Brandywine as an adjunct instructor of Earth Sciences for four semesters. I also worked as a consultant in the environmental due diligence space. After living on the East Coast for a quarter-century, I enjoy spending time exploring my new California home.
