**Welcome!** Iâ€™m Sophie, a graduate student at Stanford University who is interested in sediment transport, geomorphology, and environmental fluid mechanics. I'm pursuing a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering and work in the Bob & Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab [(EFML)](https://cee.stanford.edu/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory-efml) under the mentorship of [Dr. Nick Ouellette](https://web.stanford.edu/~nto/index.shtml). I'm currently woking on a project that investigates stress history in granular beds. My past research projects included conducting fieldwork and developing numerical models to evaluate coarse sediment transport at the White Clay Creek in Pennsylvania, and performing laboratory experiments to examine the shape changes undergone by sediment particles as they experience transport (see more under the Research tab). I have also assisted with a variety of projects including examining the stratigraphy associated with river and wetland deposits to infer historical land use changes in the Mid-Atlantic region, and investigating the effect of moisture on threshold wind speeds for aeolian transport through laboratory experiments and fieldwork at White Sands National Park in New Mexico.

I originally majored in Earth Sciences as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. During my time at Penn, I worked with Dr. Doug Jerolmack at the Penn Soft Earth Dynamics [(PennSED)](https://pennsed.seas.upenn.edu/) lab where I assisted with experiments on aeolian transport and studied particle breakdown for my senior thesis. I then pursued a M.S. in Geology at the University of Delaware, where I was advised by fluvial geomorphologist [Jim Pizzuto](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/ceoe/departments/es/faculty/james-pizzuto/).

After graduating from Delaware in 2020, I taught at Penn State Brandywine as an adjunct instructor for four semesters. I also worked as a consultant in the environmental due diligence space.
