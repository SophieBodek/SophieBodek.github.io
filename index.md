**Welcome!** Iâ€™m Sophie, a graduate student at Stanford who is interested in sediment transport, geomorphology, and environmental fluid mechanics. I'm pursuing a PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering and work in the Bob & Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab. I'm currently woking on a project that investigates stress history in granular beds.

Prior to my time at Stanford, I briefly worked as a consultant.

, an adjunct instructor at Penn State Brandywine and an environmental consultant. I recently graduated from the University of Delaware with a M.S. in Geology. As a graduate and undergraduate student, I had the opportunity to investigate a variety of topics in the field of geomorphology, often known as the science of landscapes. My past research projects included conducting fieldwork and developing numerical models to evaluate coarse sediment transport at the White Clay Creek in Pennsylvania, and performing laboratory experiments to examine the shape changes undergone by sediment particles as they experience transport (see more under the Research tab). I have also assisted with a variety of projects including examining the stratigraphy associated with river and wetland deposits to infer historical land use changes in the Mid-Atlantic region, and investigating the effect of moisture on threshold wind speeds for aeolian transport through laboratory experiments and fieldwork at White Sands National Park in New Mexico.

Sophie Bodek is currently an adjunct instructor at Penn State Brandywine and an environmental consultant. In August 2020, she graduated from the University of Delaware Department of Earth Sciences with a M.S. in Geology. Sophie was advised by fluvial geomorphologist Dr. James Pizzuto, with whom she completed a thesis titled: Is the White Clay Creek a Threshold Channel? Evaluating Bed Mobility of a Gravel-Bed River in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

Prior to graduate school, Sophie attended the University of Pennsylvania where she received a B.A. in Earth Sciences (Geology concentration) and a minor in Mathematics. As an undergraduate, Sophie worked for Dr. Douglas Jerolmack at the Penn Sediment Dynamics Laboratory where she assisted with experiments on aeolian transport and studied particle breakdown for her senior thesis.
